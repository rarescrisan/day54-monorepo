# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

Repository-specific code-writing rules (layout, naming, component conventions):
@.claude/WRITING_GUIDELINES.md

## Custom Skills

This project defines specialized skills in `.claude/skills/`:

- **`/clarify-and-plan`** — Use at the start of any non-trivial task before coding.
- **`/explore-before-coding`** — Use before writing or editing any code.
- **`/respect-the-layers`** — Use when adding code that crosses module boundaries.
- **`/complete-the-wiring`** — Use when adding new named things (config keys, env vars, packages, routes, components, dependencies).
- **`/debug-root-cause`** — Use when investigating bugs, failing tests, or unexpected behavior.
- **`/surgical-diffs`** — Use when editing existing code.
- **`/test-like-a-user`** — Use when writing or modifying tests.
- **`/verify-before-done`** — Use before committing nontrivial changes.
- **`/maintain-architecture-docs`** — Use when a change touches structure, API surface, or user-facing behavior; keeps `docs/architecture/` specs accurate.

Ticket workflow (backed by the scripts in `.claude/ticket-planner/`):

- **`/plan-tickets`** — Turn a PRD/RFC/handoff doc into Asana tasks via a reviewable dry-run folder.
- **`/work-ticket`** — Pick up a ticket by planner ID; loads design context, checks blockers, implements against acceptance criteria.
- **`/sync-tickets`** — Reconcile local ticket files and Asana when either side drifted.
- **`/kanban-review`** — Board readout: health, action items, what's ready to release.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Ticket IDs

**Tickets are identified by planner IDs like `WEB-CTA-3` — short strings minted in `.claude/ticket-planner/dry-runs/`. Asana has no human-readable issue keys; the planner ID is the durable handle.**

- `state*.json` in each dry-run folder maps planner ID → Asana task GID + permalink. Never match tickets by task name.
- Commit scopes and PR titles carry the planner ID: `feat(WEB-CTA-3): …` — that is how `/kanban-review` cross-references PRs.
- `/work-ticket` does the resolution and loads the surrounding design context — use it rather than hand-rolling the lookup.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
